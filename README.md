Coursework Submission for 2024-0508 ST-2187-03 Business Analytics, Applied Modeling and Prediction

## Repository Structure

This repository contains all the required files for the submission of my coursework project for ST2187-03. Below is a breakdown of the repository contents:

### 1. `BI_Report-Executive_Committee.pdf`
This PDF file contains the **final submission**, which includes the executive summary and the full **business intelligence report**. This report presents key insights from the dataset, including recommendations for senior management. This is the main document to reference for a comprehensive overview of the analysis.

### 2. `Dashboards_merged.pdf`
This PDF file consolidates the **five dashboards** generated from the analysis into a single document. Each dashboard visualizes different aspects of the data, such as geographic distribution, product performance, and customer retention trends. It serves as a supplementary visualization reference alongside the final report.

### 3. `Packaged Workbook.twbx`
This is the **Tableau Packaged Workbook** used to create the dashboards and conduct the analysis. It contains the original dataset, multiple **calculated fields**, and various **sheets** (some used for testing, others for the final output). The workbook also includes the **generated dashboards** and the final **Tableau story**, which ties all the insights together. Everything required for reproducing the analysis is contained in this workbook.
